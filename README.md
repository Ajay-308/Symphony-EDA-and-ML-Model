# Symphony - END to END Data Science and Machine Learning Project
Symphony is a full-stack Data Science project which utilises Machine Learining, API Integration, frontend and Backend development to create an interractive Webapp for
songs and playlist recommendations. Additionaly, a Tableau dashboard is embedded in the webapp is dockerised and a CI/CD pipeline has been setup as well. The Webapp is deployed on Amazon Web
Services at the following link: http://symmphonyai.s3-website.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com

### Technologies Used
* Python and it's Analytical and Visualisation libraries such as Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib etc.
* Machine Learning Libraries such as Scikit-learn.
* Spotify API
* Tableau for in-depth genre Analysis Dashboard.
* Flask for server side and API development.
* Docker and Amazon Web Services(AWS) for CI/CD pipleline.
* Javascript, React, HTML, CSS for frontend Development.

  
### Methods Used
